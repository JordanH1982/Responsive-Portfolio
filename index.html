                <p>I'm an aspiring web developer who loves to learn. I've studied several subjects including art, music, literature and German language. I love music and play drums in a band called American Power Nap. I love being creative, it is what drew me to Web Development. I can create, I can solve problems with many varied answers and express myself in many ways.</p>
                <p>I consider myself a pop culture nerd but I also love sports. When Star Wars night happens at the K, you can usually find me there!</p>
